# ZenDivider
A renamable divider for your tabs. Load it, Move it, Rename it.

It's just a simple single-page HTML file that has a big textbox taking up the bottom-half of the page.
You can rename the tab's title by typing into the textbox. Whatever you type into it will become the tab's title.

Great for browsers with vertical tabs.

Created as an makeshift solution while waiting for Zen Browser to implement tab folders.


# How to use it
1. Download the HTML file
2. ~Chuck~ _Put_ it somewhere on your computer
3. Open it in the browser
4. Click on the placeholder text and start typing
5. Want more dividers? Repeat and open more as needed!
