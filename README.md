# ZenDivider
A renamable divider for your tabs. Load it, Move it, Rename it.

It's just a simple single-page HTML file that has a big textbox taking up the entire bottom-half of the page.
You can rename the tab's title by typing into the textbox: Whatever you type into it will become the tab's title.

Created with Zen Browser in mind. Great for browsers with vertical tabs.

Created as an makeshift solution while waiting for [Zen Browser](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop) to [implement tab folders](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/pull/7359). It'll look like a tab folder that's always opened.


# How to use it
1. [Download](https://github.com/BarnMTB/ZenDivider/releases) the HTML file
2. ~Chuck~ _Put_ it somewhere on your computer
3. Open it in the browser
4. Click on the placeholder text and start typing
5. Rearrange it however you want
6. One is never enough. Just open that same HTML file as a different tab, as much as you want!

# Other ways to use it
- Get the Browser Extension. One button click to create a ZenDivider tab. [Learn more](https://github.com/BarnMTB/ZenDividerHelper)

## Features
- ✅ Single HTML file, offline.
- ✅ Automatically focus the textbox on open. Load in and type away!
- ✅ Press `Enter` or `Esc` to unfocus the textbox
- ✅ Light & Dark scheme matches with the browser
- ✅ Blank, transparent favicon to work as a visual indent, seperating your tabs visually; directly embeded as a 8px Base64 image for a clutter-free & low memory* experience
- ✅ Fonts that matches your system fonts for a native feel
- ✅ Color schemes that matches Microsoft Edge for a native Windows feel

## Why?
Because I just moved to Zen Browser and have so many tabs that it got as tall as Mt. Everest, making it hard to quickly scroll to the tab I want without a folder or a divider. 
Meanwhile, [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company/) has [finally admitted](https://browsercompany.substack.com/p/letter-to-arc-members-2025) that its [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) (which has tab folders) has been officially put in a ~life-support~ maintenance-only mode even on Mac, let alone on Windows which only got [half the features ported over](https://arcinternet.notion.site/Arc-for-Windows-Feature-Checklist-ffb56a81498845fc9ec9dfd6a045cd20?pvs=143) before the team moved onto developing the completely different [Dia Browser](https://diabrowser.com/). 

As much as I love using WinUI 3 apps with its smooth animations & beautiful native UI components that fit in with Windows, with Arc for Windows confirmed as having no future, moving back to it isn't really an option. And I don't want to hold back my projects just to wait for Zen to roll out folders, mess with modding browser's CSS & internal files, or go back to a traditional browser.
