<h1 align="center">ZenDivider</h1>
<p align="center">A renamable divider for your tabs.</p>
<p align="center">Load it, Move it, Rename it.</p>

It's just a simple single-page HTML file that has a big textbox taking up the entire bottom-half of the page.
You can rename the tab's title by typing into the textbox: Whatever you type into it will become the tab's title.

Created with Zen Browser in mind. Great for browsers with vertical tabs. Not tested but should work with all major browser.

Created as an makeshift solution while waiting for [Zen Browser](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop) to [implement tab folders](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/pull/7359). It'll look a bit similar to a tab folder if those can't be collapsed & has no icons.


# How to use it
1. [Download](https://github.com/BarnMTB/ZenDivider/releases) the HTML file
2. ~Chuck~ _Put_ it somewhere on your computer
3. Open it in the browser
4. Click on the placeholder text and start typing
5. Rearrange it around in the tab list however you want
6. One is never enough. Just open that same HTML file in another tab, as much as you want! You can have many open, all with different names~

# Other ways to use it
- Get the ZenDivider browser extension. Simple installation from Firefox Addons. One button click to create a ZenDivider tab without having to open file explorer. [Learn more](https://github.com/BarnMTB/ZenDividerHelper)

## Why?
  [The Browser Company of New York](https://thebrowser.company/) finally admitted officially that [Arc](https://arc.net/) is now [dead](https://browsercompany.substack.com/p/letter-to-arc-members-2025). [Dia](https://diabrowser.com/) killed it.   
  Even Arc for Mac is now abandoned. So this sealed the fate of Arc for Windows, which only got halfway in [feature parity](https://arcinternet.notion.site/Arc-for-Windows-Feature-Checklist-ffb56a81498845fc9ec9dfd6a045cd20?pvs=143) before the development stalled as seemingly everyone at TBCNY moved everyone to work on Dia.  
  Meanwhile I already fell in love with Zen before I knew it.  

  Zen is great but tabs are piling up as I work on my projects, and it's going to take a while for them to add tab folders like Arc. But without any kind of folders, it's going to be hard & slow to find the tab I want without something to categorize & divide them.  
  Then I got an idea, and I realized I can do it; that idea is ZenDivider.  

  It's not exactly the same thing as a tab folder but at least it can help alliviate my pain in a way that requires no tinkering (and thus no risk of browser breaking itself randomly one day).  
  It makes me happy if you also find ZenDivider helpful to you as well : )
